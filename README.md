# Citi Bike Analysis & Reporting

## Background

Welcome to the Citi Bike project! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, you are tasked with overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the U.S. and providing data-driven reports for city officials. Since 2013, Citi Bike has collected vast amounts of data about program usage, and your job is to build a set of reports and visualizations to help improve the program and answer key questions about its utilization.

## Objective

The main goal of this assignment is to aggregate Citi Bike trip data, identify unexpected phenomena, and create data visualizations that highlight insights. You will build a dashboard to answer key questions about ridership trends, station popularity, user behavior, and more. City officials will use this information to better understand the program and improve future decisions.

## Before You Begin

Create a Tableau Public account: You'll need a Tableau Public account to store and share your Tableau workbooks.

Download Data: You will be working with Citi Bike trip data files. Be sure to select 1-3 zip files from the Citi Bike Data source. Avoid downloading too many files as Tableau restricts the data size to 1GB.

## Project Instructions

### Data Aggregation

Aggregate Data: Use Citi Bike trip history logs from the dataset. You can merge datasets from different periods to gain more insights.

### Suggested Questions:
Total trips and percentage growth in ridership.

Analysis of short-term vs. annual subscribers.

Peak hours for bike usage during summer and winter months.

Top and bottom stations for starting and ending rides.

Average trip duration and distance by user type.

Analysis of bikes most likely due for repair.


### Design Visualizations

Create 4-10 Visualizations to highlight unexpected phenomena. Visualizations should be based on the aggregated data.

### Build Dashboards

Dashboard Creation: Use the visualizations to create dashboards that explain the identified phenomena.

Analysis Write-up: For each dashboard, include an explanation of why the phenomenon may be occurring.

### Final Presentation

Create a Tableau Story that compiles your visualizations, maps, and dashboards into a coherent, professional, and visually appealing presentation.

Share the Tableau Story: Publish your workbook to Tableau Public and submit the URL along with any additional files used in your analysis.
